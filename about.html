        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>From Eagle Scout to Appalachian Trail thru-hiker to technical manager—here's the path that got me here.</p>
    </section>

    <div class="content">
        <div class="story-section">
            <h2>The Foundation</h2>
            <p>I earned my Eagle Scout rank—the highest distinction in the Boy Scouts of America—which taught me that leadership isn't about authority, it's about earning trust through capability and commitment. That mindset has shaped how I approach technical work and team management.</p>
            
            <p>Later, I completed the St. Paul's School Advanced Studies Program focusing on LISP and Artificial Intelligence. Even back then, I was drawn to the idea that you could teach machines to solve problems—though I didn't know it would eventually mean writing Python scripts to automate support operations.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="story-section">
            <h2>The Journey</h2>
            <p>In 2019, I took a year off to thru-hike the Appalachian Trail. 2,192 miles in 100 days of actual hiking. People ask why I did it, and the honest answer is: I wanted to see if I could finish something that hard.</p>
            
            <p>That year taught me more about persistence and problem-solving than any job could. When you're 1,000 miles from the finish and your feet hurt and it's raining and you're out of food, you learn to break big problems into small steps. Mile by mile. Day by day.</p>
            
            <p>I worked odd jobs during early COVID—physical labor, driving trash trucks, whatever paid the bills. Not glamorous, but it taught me that no work is beneath me, and every job teaches you something if you pay attention.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="story-section">
            <h2>The Career</h2>
            
            <div class="timeline">
                <div class="timeline-item">
                    <h3>Customer Support Specialist</h3>
                    <div class="date">August 2021 - March 2024</div>
                    <p>Started answering basic support tickets at AutoVitals. Quickly realized that the same problems kept recurring—SQL connectivity issues, API synchronization failures, Windows service crashes. Started digging deeper instead of just closing tickets.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="timeline-item">
                    <h3>Technical Support Specialist</h3>
                    <div class="date">March 2024 - January 2025</div>
                    <p>Promoted after proving I could handle the complex escalations. Taught myself PowerShell and Python because I was tired of doing the same diagnostics manually. Started writing the tools that would eventually make the entire team more efficient.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="timeline-item">
                    <h3>Technical Support Team Lead</h3>
                    <div class="date">January 2025 - January 2026</div>
                    <p>Given responsibility for team-facing initiatives. Built the diagnostic toolsets and knowledge base articles that improved our first-contact resolution from 62% to 78%. Led the TRACS API migration that could have gone very wrong but didn't.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="timeline-item">
                    <h3>Technical Support Team Manager</h3>
                    <div class="date">January 2026 - Present</div>
                    <p>Now leading the team while staying hands-on with the technical work. Writing the automation, troubleshooting the distributed systems issues, and building a team culture focused on learning and problem-solving.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="story-section">
            <h2>The Philosophy</h2>
            
            <p>I don't believe in leadership for its own sake. I think you earn the right to lead by being someone people want to learn from. That means staying technical, staying honest, and staying focused on actual outcomes rather than titles or politics.</p>
            
            <div class="highlight">
                "I'm not a manager who used to be technical—I'm a technical person who learned to lead."
            </div>
            
            <p>When I write automation that reduces team workload by 40%, I'm not doing it to pad a performance review. I'm doing it because repetitive work is soul-crushing, and people should spend their time solving interesting problems instead of fighting with broken systems.</p>
            
            <p>When I document solutions in the knowledge base, I'm not just creating "content"—I'm making sure the next person who hits this problem doesn't have to start from zero like I did.</p>
            
            <p>That's the approach: build tools that scale, share knowledge that lasts, and lead by making everyone around you better at their jobs.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="story-section">
            <h2>What I'm Looking For</h2>
            <p>I'm exploring opportunities where technical depth and leadership intersect. Places where:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Writing code and managing people aren't seen as separate career paths</li>
                <li>Automation and efficiency are valued over "being busy"</li>
                <li>Leaders are expected to roll up their sleeves and solve hard problems</li>
                <li>Teams win by getting better, not by working more hours</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>If that sounds like your organization, let's talk.</p>
