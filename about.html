            <p>I earned my Eagle Scout rank when I was seventeen. The project itself doesn't matter as much as what the process taught me: if you want people to follow you, you have to be the person who does the work, not the person who delegates it. That stuck.</p>

            <p>Later I did the St. Paul's School Advanced Studies Program, studying LISP and artificial intelligence. This was years before AI was a LinkedIn buzzword. I just liked the idea that you could teach a machine to think through a problem. I didn't know I'd eventually be writing Python to automate support operations, but the thread was already there.</p>

            <div class="break"></div>

            <p>In 2019, I took a year off to thru-hike the Appalachian Trail. 2,192 miles in 100 days of actual hiking. People ask why I did it, and the honest answer is: I wanted to see if I could finish something that hard.</p>

            <p>That year taught me more about persistence than any job. When you're 1,000 miles from the finish and your feet hurt and it's raining and you're out of food, you learn to break big problems into small steps. Mile by mile. Day by day. It sounds like a motivational poster, but it's actually just math — you can walk 22 miles today, so do that, and then do it again tomorrow.</p>

            <p>I worked odd jobs during early COVID. Drove a trash truck. Did physical labor. Whatever paid the bills. Not glamorous, but it taught me that no work is beneath me, and every job teaches you something if you pay attention. Driving a truck teaches you routing and time management. Hauling trash teaches you that you really do want to learn Python.</p>

            <div class="break"></div>

            <p>I got hired at AutoVitals in August 2021 as a Customer Support Specialist — answering basic tickets, learning the product. Within a year I was digging into SQL connectivity issues and writing my first PowerShell scripts because I was tired of doing the same diagnostic steps by hand.</p>

            <p>By March 2024 they promoted me to Technical Support Specialist. I started building real tools — a Python suite on top of the Zendesk API, diagnostic toolsets for distributed system troubleshooting, automation that handled bulk ticket processing during security incidents. The kind of work where you write code on Monday and it saves someone three hours on Tuesday.</p>

            <p>January 2025, Team Lead. January 2026, Team Manager. Three promotions in three and a half years. Not because I'm political — I'm not. Because I kept building things that made the team better and eventually they ran out of reasons not to put me in charge.</p>

            <div class="break"></div>

            <p class="pullquote">I'm not a manager who used to be technical. I'm a technical person who learned to lead.</p>

            <p>When I write automation that cuts the team's manual workload by 40%, I'm doing it because repetitive work is soul-crushing and people should spend their time solving interesting problems. When I document solutions in the knowledge base, I'm making sure the next person who hits this problem doesn't have to start from zero like I did.</p>

            <div class="break"></div>

            <p>If you're building a team where technical depth matters and managers still write code, I'd like to hear about it.</p>
