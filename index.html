                I drove a trash truck during COVID, taught myself to code, and got promoted three times in three years. Now I build the automation platform my team runs on and ship SaaS products independently. I built the tooling that let a 3-person team absorb the work of 7. I live in a school bus. None of that is a metaphor.

            <p>I lead technical operations at AutoVitals, a B2B SaaS platform serving 200+ client installations. My team handles 163+ tickets a week. When I started, the team was 7 people and the work was manual. I wrote the Python and Node.js automation that eliminated 4 FTE worth of manual processing, then got put in charge of the team that runs on it.</p>

            <p>I troubleshoot distributed systems for a living — SQL Server connectivity, API synchronization failures, Windows services crashing at 2am. I've done crash dump analysis in WinDbg, mapped network infrastructure for clients who didn't know their own topology, and migrated an entire customer base between API versions with zero downtime.</p>

            <p>Outside work, I build full-stack applications independently — React, Supabase, Stripe, AI APIs. I want to prove I can ship a complete product end-to-end, not just one piece of it. You can see what I've built on the <a href="projects.html">projects page</a>.</p>

            <p>Before any of this, I thru-hiked the Appalachian Trail. 2,192 miles in 100 days. It taught me that most hard problems are just a lot of small problems in a row.</p>
