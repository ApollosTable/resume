                <div class="stack">react / supabase / stripe / claude api / vercel</div>
                <p>Full-stack SaaS product for marketing agencies. Agencies create client profiles with brand voice, industry, and website — then generate platform-specific posts for Google Business Profile, Facebook, Instagram, and LinkedIn using Claude. Multi-tenant auth with row-level security, three subscription tiers with Stripe billing, usage tracking with soft caps, and automated website analysis to bootstrap client profiles. This isn't a weekend project — it has real payment infrastructure, real auth, and real deployment.</p>

                <h3>Tech Support Command Center</h3>
                <div class="stack">node.js / zendesk api / jira / slack / twilio / mailgun / statuspage</div>
                <p>A 12-project internal automation platform I designed and am building for the AutoVitals support team. The centerpiece is a live command center dashboard with real-time triage queues, active incident tracking, and weekly metrics. The incident detector clusters similar Zendesk tickets to catch outages before customers start calling. The ticket triage system uses AI to categorize, route, and suggest responses. Auto-tag-and-bag links child tickets to problem tickets during incidents and sends customer updates automatically. There's also a health monitor for Twilio/Mailgun/POS integrations, auto-generated weekly reporting, and workflow tools for shop reactivations and data recovery. This is what happens when you let the person who answers the tickets architect the system.</p>

                <h3>Zendesk API Automation Suite</h3>
                <div class="stack">python / zendesk api / openai api</div>
                <p>A security incident dropped 100+ tickets in our queue simultaneously. Doing it manually would have taken the team a week. I built a Python automation suite on top of the Zendesk and OpenAI APIs that handled bulk ticket processing, GPT-powered categorization, and real-time team metrics. It now runs daily — reporting dashboards, CLI tools for common operations, automated triage. Cut our manual workload by 40%.</p>

                <h3>PowerShell Diagnostic Toolkit</h3>
                <div class="stack">powershell / windows server / sql server</div>
                <p>I got tired of running the same fifteen commands in the same order every time someone reported a sync issue. So I built a diagnostic toolkit: SQL Server connectivity checks, network path tracing, DNS verification, registry validation, and log aggregation across 200+ client installations. The team went from 62% first-contact resolution to 78%. Not because they got smarter — because the tooling got smarter.</p>

                <h3>TRACS API Migration System</h3>
                <div class="stack">python / tracs api / client communication automation</div>
                <p>NAPA deprecated their v1 API. Every affected client needed to migrate to v3 without losing a minute of uptime. I built the tracking system, automated the communication workflows, wrote validation scripts for each migration, and developed rollback procedures for anything that went sideways. Every client transitioned with zero downtime. The rollback procedures were never used.</p>

                <h3>Technical Knowledge Base</h3>
                <div class="stack">documentation / process engineering</div>
                <p>50+ technical articles. Not marketing content — troubleshooting decision trees and step-by-step procedures for SQL Server, API integrations, network connectivity, and distributed systems. Written so the next person who hits the problem doesn't start from zero. Also built the onboarding documentation that cut new engineer ramp-up time by 60%. Knowledge that compounds is the highest-leverage thing you can build.</p>
