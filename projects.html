                <h3>Zendesk API Automation Suite</h3>
                <div class="stack">python / zendesk api / openai api</div>
                <p>Built a Python automation suite on top of the Zendesk and OpenAI APIs to handle bulk ticket processing, intelligent categorization, and real-time team metrics. Started because a security incident dropped 100+ tickets in our queue simultaneously and doing it manually would have taken the team a week. The suite now handles reporting dashboards, CLI tools for common operations, and GPT-powered ticket categorization. Cut our manual workload by 40%.</p>

                <h3>PowerShell Diagnostic Toolkit</h3>
                <div class="stack">powershell / windows server / sql server</div>
                <p>A set of diagnostic scripts for troubleshooting distributed system issues across 200+ client installations. SQL Server connectivity diagnostics, network path tracing, DNS verification, registry configuration validation, and log aggregation for common failure patterns. Built it because I got tired of running the same fifteen commands in the same order every time someone reported a sync issue. Improved first-contact resolution from 62% to 78%.</p>

                <h3>TRACS API Migration System</h3>
                <div class="stack">python / tracs api / client communication automation</div>
                <p>NAPA changed their API from v1 to v3 and every affected client needed to migrate without downtime. Built a tracking system for migration status, automated the communication workflows, wrote validation scripts to verify each migration completed correctly, and developed rollback procedures for anything that went wrong. Every client transitioned with zero downtime.</p>

                <h3>Technical Knowledge Base</h3>
                <div class="stack">documentation / process engineering</div>
                <p>50+ technical articles covering SQL Server troubleshooting, API integrations, network connectivity, and distributed systems issues. Not "content" — actual troubleshooting decision trees and step-by-step procedures written so the next person who hits the problem doesn't have to start from zero. Also built the onboarding documentation that cut new engineer ramp-up time by 60%.</p>
